## About GreenPython

The GreenPython project aims to make Python scripts more energy efficient using the principles of green software. Green Software is about reducing the carbon footprint of software. Whilst software inherently does not have a carbon footprint, the hardware used to run that piece of software does.  Code that is written to use the hardware effiently will have a lower energy consumption when compared to ineffient code. One way of developing more greener software is to choose a programming language that uses hardware more efficiently. However, the choice of programming language may be based on other criteria.  A way of addressing the issue of choosing a progrmaming language which is less energy efficient is to refactor the code so that it can utilise the hardware more efficiently.

The Python programming language was chosen for this project for two reasons: 1. Its popularity, 2. Being energy ineffient when compared to other languages.

1.  Popularity

Python is the most popular langugage according to the TIOBE index of September 2025.  The 2025 StackOverflow found that Python is the fourth most used language for professional developers. However, it was ranked first for those learning to code.  

2.  Energy Efficiency.
