## About GreenPython

The GreenPython project aims to make Python scripts more energy efficient using the principles of green software. Green Software is about reducing the carbon footprint of software. Whilst software inherently does not have a carbon footprint, the hardware used to run that piece of software.  Code that is written to use the hardware effiently will have a lower energy consumption when compared to ineffient code.
